            <li data-id="playthrough_1_2"><span class="strong">(Optional)</span> For a completionist's run, I recommend starting with the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Stonesword+Key" class="purple">Stonesword Key x2</a> keepsake. They are necessary items for full completion and two of them costs at least <span class="strong">4,000 runes</span>, meaning you won't need to buy an extra two for an expensive price in the early game. You could also pick the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Lands+Between+Rune">Lands Between Rune</a> for <span class="strong">3,000 runes</span>, but if you have to buy <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Stonesword+Key" class="purple">Stonesword Keys</a> at any point, then I think picking those will give you greater value in the long run.

            <li data-id="playthrough_3_94">Congratulations! You've now completed the long and exhausting preparations part of the game! From here, I recommend using the Somber Smithing Stones [1-5] you got, to upgrade any Somber weapon you want to +5. If you're new and don't know which weapon to pick, I recommend upgrading the <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Bloodhound's+Fang">Bloodhound's Fang</a> you got earlier to +5, which can easily handle any enemy in the early-mid game, though you will need 18 STR and 17 DEX to wield it effectively.</li>
            <li data-id="playthrough_3_95">If you don't want to use a Somber weapon, that's fine. Just use your preferred weapon instead. If you have a weapon that you'd like to use for your playthrough, I'd still recommend using any Somber weapon +5 for now, while you work on upgrading your weapon of choice in the meantime.</li>
            <li data-id="playthrough_3_96">I also can't stress enough the value of leveling Vigor early. If you're following the guide and using any Somber weapon +5, then you could even level Vigor all the way up to its first soft cap of 40, which will allow you to tank pretty much anything in the early-mid game, whilst still dealing good damage, making the game much easier.</li>

          <p><span class="strong">Vigor:</span> The stat you should focus on early. Getting 40 Vigor early makes the entire early-mid game a complete joke. Combined with the fact you can start the game with a +5 Somber weapon and plenty of upgraded Flasks, you will be tanking and killing most enemies with little investment. It is not recommended to level Vigor past 60.</p>
          <p><span class="strong">Mind:</span> Although the scaling dropoff on Mind happens quite late, most builds will be fine around 20-40 Mind.</p>
          <p><span class="strong">Endurance:</span> Level based on how much stamina and equip load your build needs. You typically want to end around 40-50 Endurance.</p>
          <p><span class="strong">Strength:</span> Strength scaling largely depends on your weapon and its individual scaling when infused with an Ash of War affinity. For an accurate scaling, use a <a href="https://eip.gg/elden-ring/build-planner/">Build Planner</a>, add your weapon and play with the Strength stat until you notice diminishing returns. Keep in mind that two-handing your weapon multiplies your Strength stat by 1.5x. For example, with 20 Strength, two-handing would raise it to 30, allowing you to wield weapons that require more Strength without actually meeting the stat requirements.</p>
          <p><span class="strong">Dexterity:</span> Same as with Strength. Dex scaling depends on your weapon and its individual scaling. Use a <a href="https://eip.gg/elden-ring/build-planner/">Build Planner</a>, add your weapon of choice and play with the Dexterity stat until you notice diminishing returns.</p>
          <p><span class="strong">Intelligence:</span> For the individual scaling on each staff, I highly recommend checking out <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Intelligence">Fextra's page</a> about Intelligence.</p>
          <p><span class="strong">Faith:</span> For the individual scaling on each seal, I highly recommend checking out <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Faith">Fextra's page</a> about Faith.</p>
          <p><span class="strong">Arcane:</span> If your weapon scales with Arcane, then leveling this stat will increase the amount of Blood Loss, Poison, Sleep, and Madness buildup your weapon inflicts. A list of all weapons that scale with Arcane can be found on <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Arcane">Fextra's page</a>. Arcane is also the only stat that increases your Discovery (1 per point).</p>
          <p class="strong">General recommendation:</p>
          <ol>
            <li>Reach level requirements for your desired weapon</li>
            <li>Focus exclusively on vigor. Leveling any of the damage stats yield little value, since most weapons have poor scaling early on</li>
            <li>Level Endurance for your equip load with armor and weapon</li>
            <li>Start focusing on your dedicated stat, once your weapon has better scaling</li>

        <h2>FAQ</h2>
        <p>I'd like to thank <a href="https://github.com/zkjellberg">ZKjellberg</a> and <a href="https://github.com/smcnabb">smcnabb</a>, the creators of the previous cheat sheets that inspired this project. As someone who has used their cheat sheets countless times to make sure I didn't miss anything, I noticed no one had made something similar for Elden Ring, probably because of its open-world design and much less linear progression path. Most of the information in this guide comes from <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Elden+Ring+Wiki">Fextralife</a> and <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.gg/wiki/Eldenpedia">Eldenpedia</a>. The guide loosely follows <a href="https://www.youtube.com/@FightinCowboy">Cowboy</a>'s progression route from his <a href="https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL7RtZMiaOk8gdRf130w4gFYyhstL-5VRh">walkthrough</a> for the second and third section, and uses Map Genie's <a href="https://mapgenie.io/elden-ring/maps/the-lands-between">Elden Ring Map</a> for item locations, ensuring everything is included.</p>
        <hr />
        <h3>What's included in the playthrough?</h3>
        <p>
          <span class="strong">The playthrough <span class="red">DOES NOT</span> include:</span>
        </p>
        <ul class="not-included disc">
          <li>Any farmable items, plants, and crafting materials collected from the ground (materials picked off the wall or ground such as smithing stones or gloveworts <span class="green">ARE</span> included)</li>
          <li>Any respawning scarabs such as red and blue teardrop scarabs that fill your flasks</li>
          <li>Any stranded souls/ghosts or sword monuments that you can interact with for optional lore</li>
          <li>Any martyr effigies that you can interact with to activate co-op summon-signs for an area</li>
          <li>Any guide and gatekeeper statues, birdseye telescopes, or stakes of marika</li>
          <li>Any farmable weapons, shields or armor that drop as loot from enemies are not included in the playthrough, but can be found in the Armaments and Armor tabs respectively</li>
        </ul>
        <br />
        <p>
          <span class="strong">The playthrough <span class="green">DOES</span> include:</span>
        </p>
        <ul class="check disc">
          <li>Every single item pickup in the game (glowing pickups that you can interact with to receive an item)</li>
          <li>All achievements, bosses, NPCs, invasions, and their corresponding questlines in natural order</li>
          <li>All merchants and their items in order of when you'd come across them</li>
          <li>All sites of grace, gestures, ashes, paintings and talismans</li>
          <li>All scarabs that drop loot</li>
          <li>All illusory walls and secrets</li>
          <li>All scadutree fragments, revered spirit ashes and miquella's crosses from the DLC</li>
        </ul>
        <h3>How do I use the cheat sheet?</h3>
        <p>This project is a comprehensive walkthrough guide for Elden Ring, covering every single item pickup, NPC questlines, bosses, achievements and more. <span class="strong">If this is your first playthrough, I highly recommend that you complete the game on your own first and then use this guide for your second run.</span></p>
        <p>In the main <span class="strong">Playthrough</span> tab, you have a step by step checklist guide through the entire game. You can filter this checklist to only show steps for bosses, questlines, achievements or key-items, ideal if you don't want to follow the guide, but still want to get the important stuff. Additionally, you can use the search bar to only show items matching your search. For example, typing <samp>"Stonesword Key"</samp> in the search field and filtering by <span class="strong">Merchants</span> would show you which merchants sell stonesword keys.</p>
        <p>The <span class="strong">Achievements</span>, <span class="strong">Armaments</span>, <span class="strong">Armor</span>, and <span class="strong">Misc</span> tabs serve as separate checklists for tracking achievements, weapons, armor, gestures, ashes, and more.</p>
        <p>In the <span class="strong">Resources</span> tab, you'll find tables with useful information about the game's stat caps, upgrade materials, rune items and more.</p>
        <p>If you don't like the notebook theme, you can switch to dark mode by clicking the moon icon in the navigation bar. Click the sun icon to switch back.</p>
        <h3>Do I have to follow every step in order?</h3>
        <p>Not necessarily, this project was primarily intended for my cousin and me. Since I am a completionist, I like to make sure that I don't miss a single detail the game has to offer. This guide represents how I prefer to complete the game, reducing as much backtracking as possible and approaching the game's areas in a natural, yet efficient order. Elden Ring is a vast open world game, so if you'd rather play at your own pace, but still don't wanna miss any important questlines or achievements, give some of the filters a try.</p>
        <h3>Will I get all achievements if I follow the guide?</h3>
        <p>Yes! All achievements, including every step to get them are covered in the <span class="strong">Playthrough</span> tab. If you're following the guide and playing on PlayStation, you'll naturally get the <span class="strong">Platinum Trophy</span> just by following each step. You can filter the playthrough to only show achievement-related steps and which order you'll get them in. Check out the <span class="strong">Achievements</span> tab for a checkbox list of all the achievements.</p>
        <h3>Are there any missable things in Elden Ring?</h3>
        <p>Yes, many things in Elden Ring are missable. While most of them are quest-related, some achievements can be <span class="red">permanently missed</span> until your next playthrough. Every missable entry is clearly labeled <span class="red">(Missable!)</span>, so that they can be easily searched and filtered by typing "missable" into the search bar. Missable entries that don't give any item or reward are labeled <span class="strong">(Optional)</span>. You won't miss anything if you're following the guide.</p>
        <h3>How long does it take to 100% complete Elden Ring?</h3>
        <p>A 100% completion playthrough of Elden Ring following this guide, including getting all three endings in a single run, typically takes between <span class="strong">60-90 hours</span>, accounting for variables like differences in playstyles and player skill. The guide is optimized to avoid unnecessary backtracking where possible, while approaching the game in a natural order.</p>
        <h3>What level should I be for each area?</h3>
        <p>The guide provides recommended level ranges for each area in Elden Ring. These ranges do not represent the difficulty of an area, but rather the level you're likely to reach naturally when following the guide. These are suggestions based on typical progression from various of my own playthroughs, and could help you avoid being over- or under-leveled if you want a fair experience.</p>
        <h3>What do I do if I accidentally attacked an NPC?</h3>
        <p>You should <span class="red">never attack or kill an NPC</span> in Elden Ring unless it's specifically stated to do so in the guide. If you've attacked any NPCs and they've become hostile, then you'll need to travel to <a href="https://mapgenie.io/elden-ring/maps/the-lands-between?locationIds=165501">Church of Vows</a> in Liurnia and absolve your sins in front of the statue there by using a <a href="https://eldenring.wiki.fextralife.com/Celestial+Dew" class="purple">Celestial Dew</a>. If you've already killed an NPC, then their questline is over until you start a new playthrough. Make sure to pick up their bell bearing if they were selling any items.</p>
        <h3>How do I navigate in Elden Ring using compass directions?</h3>
        <p>Elden Ring's compass uses <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cardinal_direction#/media/File:Brosen_windrose.svg" aria-label="Visual reference to the cardinal directions">primary, intercardinal and secondary-intercardinal directions</a>. I strongly recommend keeping the compass HUD enabled as the guide uses it to provide accurate directions. Below are the tiers used to help provide directions:</p>
        <ol class="compass">
          <li>
            Primary Cardinal Directions:
            <ul class="disc">
              <li>North (N)</li>
              <li>East (E)</li>
              <li>South (S)</li>
              <li>West (W)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Intercardinal Directions:
            <ul class="disc">
              <li>Northeast (NE)</li>
              <li>Southeast (SE)</li>
              <li>Southwest (SW)</li>
              <li>Northwest (NW)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
          <li>
            Secondary Intercardinal Directions:
            <ul class="disc">
              <li>North-Northeast (NNE)</li>
              <li>East-Northeast (ENE)</li>
              <li>East-Southeast (ESE)</li>
              <li>South-Southeast (SSE)</li>
              <li>South-Southwest (SSW)</li>
              <li>West-Southwest (WSW)</li>
              <li>West-Northwest (WNW)</li>
              <li>North-Northwest (NNW)</li>
            </ul>
          </li>
        </ol>
        <p>For an in-game example, <span class="strong">northeast</span> refers to the midpoint between north and east. Similarly, <span class="strong">north-northeast</span> would then refer to the midpoint between north and northeast.</p>
        <h3>Can I use the cheat sheet for multiple characters?</h3>
        <p>Yes! You can create, edit, and delete profiles using the buttons in the navigation bar. Any stored information is saved separately to your selected profile.</p>
        <h3>How are the checklists saved?</h3>
        <p>The checklists are saved to your browser's local storage. This means that <span class="red">clearing your browser's cache, will destroy any saved progress</span>.</p>
        <h3>I noticed an error in the cheat sheet! How can I contribute?</h3>
        <p>Visit the project's repository on <a href="https://github.com/rdmaw/elden-ring-cheat-sheet">GitHub</a>. Check if someone has already reported the same issue and if not, open a new issue detailing the error. If you want to contribute directly, I recommend you fork the project, make your suggested changes and open a pull request.</p>
